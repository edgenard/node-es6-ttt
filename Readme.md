# Command Line Tic Tac Toe in es6/2015

An attempt to write a cli tic-tac-toe game in node and es6/2015 using as many pure functions as possible.

The main logic is a series of pure functions that are tested and the interactive part uses node's readline module and is not tested.

To play

```
npm install
npm rebuild
npm run play
```

To test
```
npm test
```
