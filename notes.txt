What is the player function?
  - It needs a mark
  - When playing I need to ask player 1 then player 2, how will this be handled?
  - Can player be just data like the board, maybe a string representing the mark?
  - If it is just data, what does this mean for computer player?
  - Can the player function use all the other functions?
